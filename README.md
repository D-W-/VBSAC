### Introduction of VBSAC

### Benchmark Composition

All the benchmark test cases are listed in `benchmark` folder. All the cases either from widely-used benchmarks or real-world projects. We have modified some of them, including fixing irrelevant bugs, re-organizing the files for better precision and recall testing and so on. Currently, we only summarize the pointer-range relevant cases.
